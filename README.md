# WCUPA-Degree-Visualizer-CSC-402-
This project for Dr. Linh Ngo creates a website to help WCUPA CS students visualize their progress toward graduation. It features a degree progression chart, schedule customization to avoid work/commute conflicts, and real-time updates using WCUPAâ€™s semester schedule API. Inspired by prior API work: Unofficial Ellucian Banner API.
